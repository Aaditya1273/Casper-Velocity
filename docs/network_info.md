Casper Network Chain & Wallet Information (December 28, 2025)
Casper Network is a non-EVM Layer-1 blockchain (uses WebAssembly/Rust contracts), so it doesn't have a traditional "Chain ID" like EVM chains (e.g., no CAIP-2 standard yet fully adopted). Instead, networks are identified by chain name in deploys and configurations.

Testnet:
casper-test
https://rpc.testnet.casperlabs.io or https://testnet.cspr.live/rpc
https://testnet.cspr.live/
Faucet: https://testnet.cspr.live/tools/faucet

Liquid Staking Token: Native liquid staking is live (integrated via WiseLending). Stake CSPR → receive sCSPR (liquid staked CSPR), which earns rewards and can be used in DeFi (lending, pools, etc.).
Block Time: ~8 seconds (post-2.1 upgrade).
Gas Fees: Very low, predictable (fixed in motes).

Wallets & Integration
For dApp development (especially hackathon projects), use CSPR.click – the unified SDK that connects to multiple wallets with one integration. It's the recommended way for seamless wallet connect, signing, and fiat on-ramps.
